<p>Verse 1:
What if I couldn't speak,<br/>
What if I couldn't eat,<br/>
What if I couldn't move,<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>


<br/>Verse 2:<br/>
What if my body ached,<br/>
And I always made you late,<br/>
What if I couldn't wait,<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>


<br/>Chorus:<br/>
Would you love me when it's hard<br/>
And our life's fallen apart,<br/>
If the things that we once knew are long gone,<br/>
If our blue skies turn to grey,<br/>
And my memory fades away,<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
<br/>Verse 3:<br/>
What if I'm complicated<br/>
Always leaving you frustrated,<br/>
Nothing ever went quite right,<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>

<br/>Wish I could let you know what the future holds<br/>
But that's a promise I can't make<br/>
Through the good and bad happy and sad<br/>
Love is a risk that we must take<br/>


<br/>[Bridge]<br/>
If I could speak again<br/>
I'd ask you to remember when<br/>
We first met and fell in love<br/>
We were so young and dumb<br/>
But our love was so strong<br/>
Memories of those late nightstan<br/>
Are what fuel this fight<br/>


<br/>[Chorus]<br/>
Would you love me when it's hard<br/>
And our life's fallen apart<br/>
If the things that we once knew are long gone<br/>
If our blue skies turn to grey<br/>
And my memory fades away<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
Would you still love me?<br/>
