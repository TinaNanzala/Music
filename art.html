  <p><strong>FRIENDS</strong><br/><br/>
Friendship is one of lifes greatest treasures.<br/>
Friends that are loyal arte always there to<br/>
make you laugh when you are down,<br>
They are not afraid  to help you avoid mistakes<br/> 
They never let you down nor ditch you<br/>
Always there to look out for your best interest.<br/>
This kind of friend can be hard to find,but<br/>
they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime.<br/>
That bracelet that is worn on your wrist meant for friendship <br/>
never gets off that wrist ,<br/>
Others may not be quite as loving<br/>
The pain caused by friendship marred by <br/>
Betrayal is not easy to overcome.
Infact,<br/>many find the in spiration from the joy brought brought about by a friend 
or the pain caused by a failed friendship.<br/>
